  <md:title>Conducting a Nonparametric Paired Samples t-test</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Conducting a Nonparametric Paired Samples t-test is Chapter 7 of Calculating Basic Statistical Procedures in SPSS: A Self-Help and Practical Guide to Preparing Theses, Dissertations, and Manuscripts, authored by John R. Slate and Ana Rojas-LeBouef from Sam Houston State University. This book is written to assist graduate students and faculty members, as well as undergraduate students, in their use of the Statistical Package of the Social Sciences-PC (SPSS-PC) versions 15-19.  Specifically, we have generated a set of steps and screenshots to depict each important step in conducting basic statistical analyses.  We believe that this book supplements existing statistical texts in which readers are informed about the statistical underpinnings of basic statistical procedures and in which definitions of terms are provided.  Accordingly, other than providing a few basic definitions, we assume that dissertation chairs/thesis directors, students, and/or faculty will obtain their own definition of terms.  We hope you find this set of steps and screenshots to be helpful as you use SPSS-PC in conducting basic statistical analyses.</md:abstract>

      <title>Conducting a Nonparametric Paired Samples <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-test</title>
      <para id="eip-847">In this set of steps, readers will calculate either a parametric or a nonparametric statistical analysis, depending on whether the data for the dependent variable reflect a normal distribution.  A parametric statistical procedure requires that its data be reflective of a normal curve whereas no such assumption is made in the use of a nonparametric procedure.  Of the two types of statistical analyses, the parametric procedure is the more powerful one in ascertaining whether or not a statistically significant difference, in this case, exists.  As such, parametric procedures are preferred over nonparametric procedures.  When data are not normally distributed, however, parametric analyses may provide misleading and inaccurate results.  According, nonparametric analyses should be used in cases where data are not reflective of a normal curve.  In this set of steps, readers are provided with information on how to make the determination of normally or nonnormally distributed data.  For detailed information regarding the assumptions underlying parametric and nonparametric procedures, readers are referred to the Hyperstats Online Statistics Textbook at http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/  or to the Electronic Statistics Textbook (2011) at http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/
</para><para id="eip-151">For this nonparametric dependent samples <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-test to be appropriately used, at least half of the standardized skewness coefficients and the standardized kurtosis coefficients must be outside the normal range (+/-3, Onwuegbuzie &amp; Daniel, 2002).  Research questions for which nonparametric dependent samples <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-test are appropriate involve asking for differences in a dependent variable by group membership (i.e., only two groups are present for the <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-test and, in this case, their scores are connected).  The research question, “What is the effect of the new science program on student science performance among elementary school students?” could be answered through use of a nonparametric dependent dependent <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-test.
